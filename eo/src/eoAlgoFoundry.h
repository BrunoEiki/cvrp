/** Interface of a Foundry: a class that instantiate an eoAlgo on-the-fly, given a choice of its operators.
 *
 * The chosen operators are encoded in a vector of numbers.
 *
 * The foundry subclass should first be set up with sets of operators of the same interface,
 * held within an eoOperatorFoundry member.
 * @code
 *   eoOperatorFoundry< eoSelectOne<EOT> > selectors;
 * @endcode
 *
 * In a second step, the operators to be used should be selected
 * by indicating their index, just like if the foundry was an array:
 * @code
 *   foundry.select({size_t{0}, size_t{1}, size_t{2}});
 *   //                     ^          ^          ^
 *   //                     |          |          |
 *   //                     |          |          + 3d operator
 *   //                     |          + 2d operator
 *   //                     + 1st operator
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you don't (want to) recall the order of the operators in the encoding,
 * you can use the `index()` member of eoOperatorFoundry, for example:
 * @code
 *   foundry.at(foundry.continuators.index()) = size_t{2}; // select the third continuator
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, you must implement the foundry just like any eoAlgo, by using the eoPop interface:
 * @code
 *   foundry(pop);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * It will instantiate the needed operators (only) and the algorithm itself on-the-fly,
 * and then run it.
 * 
 * @note The "encoding" which represent the selected options, figuring the actual meta-algorithm,
 *        is a vector of `std::variant`, which can hold either a `size_t` or a `double`.
 *        The first one is used to indicate the index of an operator class
 *        *or* a parameter which is a size.
 *        The second is used to store numerical parameters values.
 *
 * @note Thanks to the underlying eoOperatorFoundry, not all the added operators are instantiated.
 *        Every instantiation is deferred upon actual use. That way, you can still reconfigure them
 *        at any time with `eoForgeOperator::setup`, for example:
 *        @code
 *        foundry.selector.at(0).setup(0.5); // using constructor's arguments
 *        @endcode
 *
 * @warning If the managed constructor takes a reference *YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY* wrap it
 *          in a `std::ref` when using `add` or `setup`, or it will silently be passed as a copy,
 *          which would effectively disable any link between operators.
